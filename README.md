# DrySponge

##NOTE: As of Minecraft 1.15 this is now in Vanilla.

A Bukkit/Spigot server plugin for Minecraft.

No water is allowed in the Nether dimension, so i made this plugin to dry all wet sponges you place in the Nether dimension.

### Installation
 - Download "drysponge.jar" and place it in the plugins folder of your server.
 - If you see "DrySponge has been enabled." when you start the server, It's working.
